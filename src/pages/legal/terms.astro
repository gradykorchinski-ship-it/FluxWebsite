                    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and
                    use of the FluxLinux website and any related online services
                    we provide (together, the “Services”). By using the
                    Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do
                    not use the Services.
                </p>

                <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
                <p>
                    “FluxLinux”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refers to the FluxLinux
                    Project. Contact: <strong>help@fluxlinux.xyz</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>2) What these Terms cover</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms apply to the Services (the website, downloads
                    page, documentation site, newsletter signups, etc.). The
                    FluxLinux operating system software itself is distributed
                    under its own open-source licenses, which are provided with
                    the software and take precedence for the software
                    components.
                </p>

                <h2>3) Acceptable use</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree not to misuse the Services. For example, you must
                    not:
                </p>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or
                        related systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        disrupt, overload, or interfere with the Services
                        (including via scraping or abusive automation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        upload or transmit malware, exploits, or other harmful
                        code
                    </li>
                    <li>use the Services for unlawful activity</li>
                    <li>misrepresent yourself or the FluxLinux Project</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4) Downloads, integrity, and safety</h2>
                <p>
                    We may provide downloads (e.g., ISO images, checksums,
                    signatures) and links to mirrors. You are responsible for
                    verifying downloads (e.g., checksum/signature verification)
                    and for ensuring that the software is suitable for your use.
                    Running operating system installers can modify disks; back
                    up first.

                <p>
                    The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the
                    fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties,
                    express or implied, including fitness for a particular

                </p>

                <h2>9) Limitation of liability</h2>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permitted by law, FluxLinux and its
                    contributors will not be liable for any indirect,
                    incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
                    any loss of data, profits, revenues, or goodwill, arising
                    out of or related to your use of the Services or software.
                </p>

                <h2>10) Indemnification</h2>
                <p>
                    If your use of the Services violates these Terms or
                    applicable law and causes us harm, you agree to indemnify
                    and hold us harmless from related claims and expenses.
                </p>

                <h2>11) Suspension and termination</h2>
                <p>
                    We may suspend or terminate access to the Services if we
                    reasonably believe you have violated these Terms, are
                    abusing the Services, or pose a security risk. We may also
                    modify or discontinue parts of the Services.
                </p>

                <h2>12) Changes to these Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes take
                    effect when posted on this page. Your continued use of the
                    Services after changes become effective means you accept the
                    updated Terms.
                </p>
