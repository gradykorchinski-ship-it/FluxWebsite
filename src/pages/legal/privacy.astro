                    This Privacy Policy explains how the FluxLinux Project
                    (“FluxLinux”, “we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares
                    information when you use our website and related online
                    services (the “Services”).
                </p>

                <h2>1) What this policy covers</h2>
                <p>
                    This policy covers information collected by the Services
                    (website, docs/help site, blog, newsletter signup, download
                    pages). It does not automatically cover third-party services
                    we link to (mirrors, vendors, social platforms), which have
                    their own privacy policies.
                </p>

                <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
                <p>Depending on how you use the Services, we may collect:</p>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Basic log data:</strong> IP address, device/browser
                        type, pages requested, timestamps, and referring URL. Most
                        web servers collect this by default for security and reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Messages you send us:</strong> if you contact us (email,
                        forms), we receive what you send plus the metadata necessary
                        to reply.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cookies/local storage:</strong> small bits of data
                        used for preferences (like theme) or essential functionality.
                        If you don’t use cookies, say so.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>to operate and maintain the Services</li>
                    <li>to secure the Services and prevent abuse</li>
                    <li>
                        to understand what content is useful (analytics), if
                        enabled
                    </li>
                    <li>to respond to support requests and communications</li>
                    <li>
                        to send newsletters/updates if you explicitly subscribe
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4) Legal bases (where applicable)</h2>
                <p>
                    Where required by law, we process information based on one
                    or more of the following: operating the Services (legitimate
                    interests), your consent (e.g., newsletter), and compliance
                    with legal obligations.
                </p>

                <h2>5) Sharing and disclosure</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not sell personal information. We may share
                    information only in limited cases:
                </p>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Service providers:</strong> hosting/CDN, analytics,
                        email/newsletter provider, and security tooling, only as needed
                        to run the Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> if required to comply
                        with law or valid legal process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Security:</strong> to protect the Services and users
                        against abuse or attacks.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We retain information only as long as necessary for the
                    purposes described above. For example, server logs may be
                    kept for a limited period for security and troubleshooting.
                    Newsletter data is retained until you unsubscribe.
                </p>

                <h2>7) Your choices</h2>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cookies:</strong> you can manage cookies through your
                        browser settings (if used).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Analytics:</strong> if we use cookie-based analytics,
                        you can block cookies or use browser-level tracking protections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Access/Deletion:</strong> if you contact us, you can
                        request access to or deletion of personal data we hold about
                        you, subject to legal requirements and technical constraints.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8) International transfers</h2>
                <p>
                    If we use hosting or service providers in other countries,
                    your information may be processed outside your country. We
                    take reasonable steps to protect it consistent with this
                    policy.
                </p>

                <h2>9) Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We use reasonable security measures appropriate to the
                    nature of the Services. No system is perfectly secure, so we
                    can’t guarantee absolute security.
                </p>

                <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy. Updates take effect when
                    posted here, and the “Effective date” will change.
                </p>
