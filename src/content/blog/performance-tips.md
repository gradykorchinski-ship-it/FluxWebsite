FluxLinux is fast by design. Here are five practical adjustments to squeeze more performance:

1. Disable unused systemd services
2. Prefer lightweight apps (e.g., `mpv` over heavy media players)
3. Tune I/O scheduler for SSDs
4. Use a trimmed kernel config for specialized systems
5. Keep background indexing disabled unless needed

Each of these can save memory and reduce latency; add examples or PRs on our [GitHub](https://github.com/gradykorchinski-ship-it/FluxWebsite).
